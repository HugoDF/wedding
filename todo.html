        <p>We know that many of you will be travelling long distance to come to Pelion. We are very much thankful for this and we are excited to see you there!!!</p>
        <p>If you decide to combine our wedding with some extra days of vacations, Greece offers endless choices. Here are some that are close to our wedding destination…</p>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Pelion</h2>
          <p>Mount Pelion is a place of immense beauty and variety. It is by no chance that is was chosen as the summer house of the Greek Olympian Gods! You can spend half your days hiking and exploring the beautiful small villages along with the local cuisine; and the other half sunbathing and in one of the many beaches to the east or the west of Pelion. We hope that our wedding activities will give you a small taste of both but if you want more, the link below might give you some ideas.</p>

          <p>If you are interested in activities such as cooking lessons, sailing, canoe kayaking, trekking, horse riding, biking, scuba diving, and canoeing, contact our cool wedding planner, Eleni, through her website <a href="http://www.whatifexperiences.com">www.whatifexperiences.com</a></p>
          <p>If again you are more of the lazy type, the following link might be more interesting <a href="http://www.trainose.gr/en/tourism-culture/train-and-recreation/the-pelion-train/">www.trainose.gr/en/tourism-culture/train-and-recreation/the-pelion-train/</a></p>
          <p>On your way to Pelion, don’t forget to stop in Volos to grab a bite and drink some tsipouro!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Sporades</h2>
          <p>Sporades is a complex of islands in north Aegean sea, very easily accessible from Volos by ferry. Skiathos and Skopelos are the more visited among the islands, and while they are not the typical white-and-blue Cyclades islands they are surrounded by crystal blue seas and stunning natural sceneries. If the idea of spending some days in Sporades sounds tempting a look at photos of Lalaria beach in Skiathos and Agios Ioannis chapel in skopelos will seal the deal!</p>

        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Thessaloniki</h2>
          <p>It’s not because it is our home city that we suggest to take a few days to explore it if you travel through Thessaloniki. Thessaloniki has been repeatedly named as a top European party destination and Financial Times FDI magazine has included it in its list of European cities of the future for human capital and lifestyle!</p>
          <p>Walk on the quay and have coffee gazing at the golf of Thermaikos. Visit the old city and its walls, the recently reopened Rotunda, and the Modiano market. Visit the church of Saint Demetrios and the Archaeological or the Byzantine museum, or both! Have dinner at Ladadika. And then have drinks in one of the many cafés/bars on Metropoleos street or Proksenou Koromila street. Or even better at Aigli behind the Saint Demetrios church. Or Shark on the east. Or Villa Luna in the Panorama district. Or anywhere it feels inviting! We could go on forever…</p>

          <p>If you do decide to visit Thessaloniki, let us know and if we* are not getting crazy about the last details of the wedding we will happily be your guides!</p>
          <p>And one last thing…if you have more than a couple of days, visit Halkidiki for some of its beaches really worth it!!!</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.visit-halkidiki.gr/">www.visit-halkidiki.gr/</a></p>
          <p>* By we here we mean Fani; Pano’s will most likely jump to the chance to do something else other than preparing for the wedding!</p>

        <div class="subsection">
          <h2>Meteora</h2>
          <p>Meteora is an area of high natural and religious importance that is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. A set of immense rocks, split by earthquakes and weathered by water and wind over millions of years, are combined to create a breathtaking landscape. On top of those rocks today reside 24 monasteries, some of which date back to the 14th century.</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.meteora-greece.com">www.meteora-greece.com</a></p>
          <p>Meteora is less than 2 hours drive from Volos and can also be reached by train even though the journey in that case might be much longer. If you take the train, get off in Kalampaka and then travel by taxi or feet.</p>
